## Ayra Association Antitrust Policy

### 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Ayra Association (hereinafter referred to as "Ayra" or "the Association") is committed to fostering open collaboration while ensuring full compliance with all applicable antitrust and competition laws. This Antitrust Policy (the "Policy") is established to guide all activities of the Association, its members, participants, and staff to avoid any conduct that could raise antitrust concerns.

The mission of Ayra is to enable global interoperability of verifiable data—especially verifiable digital credentials—across digital trust ecosystems of any size, type, or location. In pursuing this mission, Ayra operates as a neutral international non-profit organization that provides open, multi-stakeholder governance for global trust infrastructure.

This Policy affirms Ayra's commitment to conduct all activities in accordance with applicable antitrust laws. The purpose of this Policy is to:

1. Ensure that all activities of Ayra comply with applicable antitrust laws;
2. Establish clear guidelines for members, participants, and staff to prevent antitrust violations;
3. Minimize antitrust risks associated with collaboration among competitors within the Association; and
4. Maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the Association's work.

### 2. Scope and Applicability
