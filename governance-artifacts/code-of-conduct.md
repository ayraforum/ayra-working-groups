# Code of Conduct

We are working towards formal policies and procedures for our code of conduct. The Ayra Transitional Board of Directors has this as an active work item.&#x20;

In the meantime, please operate under the following principles:

* **Be Kind** — This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and curiosity help, especially in situations of high pressure and urgency. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unfair, or unwelcome behavior or advances. Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically, or sexually or discriminate based on personal characteristics or group membership. &#x20;
* **Take Space / Make Space —** If you tend to speak first, pause to allow others to share their ideas. If you tend not to speak up, please do. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others.&#x20;
* **Act Transparently —** Be honest about your qualifications and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.&#x20;
* **Respect Privacy —** Respect others’ privacy and the confidentiality of the data you access.
* **Stay on Topic —** Ensure you post to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. When you update an issue or respond to an email, you are potentially sending it to a large number of people.&#x20;
* **Maintain Forward Motion —** We advance by focusing on what is possible in the moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion and are not used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and keep walking.  We'll return to unearth it later.
* **Seek Solutions —** This work is so complex that focusing on what won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas is vulnerable but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
* **Take Responsibility** — Take action in support of these agreements, especially if you are in a leadership position. When inappropriate behaviours are observed, bring the discussion back to a more civil level. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices.&#x20;
* **Step Down Considerately —** Members of every project come and go. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure others can pick up where you left off.
