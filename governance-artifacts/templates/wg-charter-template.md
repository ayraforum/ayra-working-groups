* As new problem areas or work items are identified, any Ayra member may propose to charter a working group.   
* Proponents work with the Ayra staff to draft a charter for approval by the Board (or a Committee designated by the Board) or Executive Director.
* The Working Group charter should specify:  
  * What is expected to be produced.   
  * Who is chairing the group (co-chairs, up to three, are recommended).  
  * Who the participants should be (minimally, to assure multi-stakeholder progress).  
  * How group decisions are made.
  * How the group will work/how to get involved.
  * How long it will be active, after which it can be renewed or dissolved by the Board (or a Committee designated by the Board).  
* Once created, each working group is staffed and chaired and can decide things in-scope and bring them to the Board (or a Committee designated by the Board) for ratification.
* Working Groups may also delegate to task forces with their own chairs or co-chairs, who bring completed work back to the working group for approval and direction.
