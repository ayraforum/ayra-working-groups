# Project & Working Group Process (DRAFT)

## Introduction

This document defines the process for creating and managing Ayra Association Projects and Working Groups (the “Process”). It describes how members of the Ayra Association (“Ayra” or the “Association”) initiate these collaborative initiatives and how they are governed. Projects and Working Groups are organizational structures operating under the Association’s umbrella (they are not separate legal entities). They rely on Ayra’s overall governance and policies to enable effective collaboration.

This Process is designed to foster innovation in a structured yet flexible way. By delineating phases of growth, criteria for success, and governance expectations, the objective is to ensure that collaborative initiatives can flourish with transparency and accountability. Whether a project is focused on governing shared digital trust infrastructure, creating digital trust ecosystems, or driving adoption of new technologies, this Process provides a consistent framework for members to coalesce around shared goals.&#x20;

The Process emphasizes openness, inclusive participation across Ayra’s diverse member base, and oversight of resources – anchored in Ayra’s principles and community decision processes. Through this Process, Ayra Members and staff work hand-in-hand to turn promising concepts into impactful outcomes for the community and beyond. All participants are encouraged to familiarize themselves with this document, abide by its spirit and letter, and contribute constructively to the evolution of Ayra’s Projects and Working Groups.

## Related Documents

The following documents define the governance of Ayra in general, and Projects and Working Groups in particular:

\[To be added]

This Process inherits its governance principles from Ayra’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) and Bylaws. Should any conflict exist between this Process and the Articles or Bylaws, the Articles and Bylaws shall prevail. Where this Process or a specific Project or Working Group’s Charter is silent on a topic, the Articles and Bylaws will serve as guidance, and the Executive Director (or a delegate) of Ayra will clarify the appropriate practice. Projects and Working Groups do not form a formal part of the Ayra governance structure as defined in the Bylaws.

## Guiding Principles

All Projects and Working Groups must operate in an open and transparent manner. _Open_ means all Members have the same opportunity to participate under the rules defined in the charter of a Project or Working Group; no arbitrary barriers or exclusionary rules may be imposed on potential contributors including direct competitors in the marketplace. _Transparent_ means that proceedings and outputs of the group – such as meeting minutes, plans, decisions, and other artifacts – are kept openly available to participants and, where appropriate, to the public.

All Projects and Working Groups, like all Ayra community activities, must adhere to the Ayra Association Code of Conduct and all applicable policies, including the Antitrust and Competition Policy and Intellectual Property Policies (_e.g._, issue advance meeting notices, publish agendas, record accurate minutes, and avoid any collusive behaviour). Participants are expected to uphold professional standards and legal compliance at all times. The Ayra Community Decision Process applies to group decision-making, favouring consensus first and providing an asynchronous voting and appeal path when consensus cannot be reached. Further, each Project or Working Group should strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion in its membership and leadership.&#x20;

### **Suitability of Projects and Working Groups**

The presence of certain foundational conditions can help members evaluate if Ayra is the right forum for an initiative: Does the initiative require participation from multiple stakeholder groups? Will it be able to operate fully within Ayra’s antitrust policy and legal framework? Will it benefit from Ayra’s role as a neutral convening platform? Will it benefit Ayra’s ability to facilitate, guide, or in some cases directly lead strategic collaboration?

### **Relationship between Projects and Working Groups**

_Projects_ are initiatives that typically require specific funding, dedicated support staff, and is aimed at a particular delivery goal. A Project is funded through its own budget (which rolls up into the Association’s budget). A Project is intended for broad, strategic efforts and is governed by a Project Management Committee as defined in its Charter.&#x20;

_Working Groups_ are focused collaborations organized to address a specific problem area or deliverable. A Working Group may exist within a Project or at an Ayra level. Working Groups typically operate with a more limited scope than Projects. Working Groups that are not tied to a Project are expected to be few and funded from Ayra’s general budget, while Working Groups under a Project are funded through the Project’s own budget. Any Working Group formed outside of a Project will follow the same process outlined in this document, treating the Association itself as the sponsoring umbrella Project.

### **Member-led and Ayra-led Initiatives**

Projects and Working Groups are generally initiated and led by one or more Ayra members (“Member-led”). However, the Association, through its Executive Director, may also directly initiate a Project or Working Group that is deemed strategic for Ayra (“Ayra-led”). In an Ayra-led Project, the Executive Director or a designated staff member may serve as the interim Chair of its Project Management Committee to provide direct leadership and oversight on behalf of the Association.

## Membership and Participation

Participation in any Ayra Project or Working Group is open to all Ayra members in good standing, regardless of membership class, subject to any Charter-specific criteria. Any Ayra member may propose the creation of a new Project or Working Group.

### **Initiative Lead**

An _Initiative Lead_ is the Ayra member (or members) taking a leadership role in proposing and proving the viability of a Project or Working Group. The Initiative Lead(s) work closely with Ayra staff during the initiative’s formation phases, provides initial resources or funding, and champions the effort. Any Ayra’s member can serve as an Initiative Lead, provided that the proposed initiative garners sufficient support and meets the entry criteria defined in the [Exploration Phase](project-and-working-group-process.md#entry-criteria) (including securing initial funding).&#x20;

### **Participant**

A _Participant_ is any Ayra member that has formally joined a Project or Working Group and agreed to its Charter and participation terms. Participants sign the Participation Agreement (defined [here](project-and-working-group-process.md#participation-agreement)), committing to abide by the Charter’s policies and to contribute resources or fees as required. Participants have the right to be involved in the group’s activities and governance (including voting in the Project’s committees, as applicable) as defined by the Charter. Charters may specify objective criteria for participation – for example, a minimum resource commitment, specific expertise, or membership class – but these criteria must be fair, reasonable, and not designed to exclude potential contributors arbitrarily. Additional roles (such as advisors, observers, etc.) may also be defined in the Charter as needed.

### **Non-Members**

While governance and decision-making roles are reserved for Ayra members, non-member organizations or individuals are welcome to provide financial sponsorship or other resources to a Project or Working Group if the Charter allows. However, they must join the Association to receive participation rights or governance authority.

## Formation and Lifecycle Phases

Ayra Projects and Working Groups progress through a four-phase lifecycle: _Exploration_, _Proposal_, _Development_, and _Execution_. This lifecycle ensures a structured evolution from initial concept to full operation, with defined checkpoints and criteria at each stage. Every initiative must satisfy the _Entry Criteria_ to enter the Exploration phase and the subsequent _Exit Criteria_ to successfully move to the next phase (or to completion), as shown below.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Overview of Lifecycle Phases</p></figcaption></figure>

### Exploration Phase

The _Exploration Phase_ is the inception of a Project or Working Group. In this phase, the proposers (Initiative Lead(s) and/ or any early supporters) work with Ayra Association staff to explore and validate the idea’s initial viability and lay the groundwork for a formal proposal. The group remains informal and not publicly announced during Exploration, allowing candid assessment, discussion, and planning. Key activities include defining the vision and scope of the initiative, identifying a potential Initiative Lead if not already clear, and starting to draft the foundational documents.

#### **Entry Criteria**

* **Proposal:** A clear concept or problem statement for the proposed Project or Working Group has been formulated, and an initial expression of interest has been communicated to the Ayra Association.
* **Commitment:** At least one member is willing to act as the Initiative Lead for the effort, and is prepared to secure or provide initial resources to support the formation.
* **Approval:** The Association’s Executive Director (or a delegate) has reviewed the concept and given approval to proceed with exploration, assigning a _Project Manager_ (whether an Ayra staff liaison or an external contractor, as resources allow) to assist the effort. This approval is typically formalized by agreeing to initiate the drafting of an Initiation Agreement as described below.

#### **Activities in Exploration**

The Initiative Lead works closely with the Project Manager to refine the proposal. They will draft a preliminary Charter outlining the vision, scope, and objectives of the initiative. They will also negotiate an Initiation Agreement with the Ayra Association to capture the goals, scope, initial resources, and milestones for creating the group. The Initiation Agreement serves as a memorandum of understanding between the Initiative Lead(s) and Ayra, ensuring commitment to fund and support the start-up activities until the group can be self-sustaining through broader participation. During Exploration, the Initiative Lead and Ayra staff may privately reach out to gauge interest from other potential participants to form an initial “participant pipeline”. Although Ayra does not sign NDAs or confidentiality agreements as a rule, discussions in this phase are kept within the interested parties and Ayra staff; the concept is not broadly advertised until ready.

#### **Exit Criteria**

* **Initiative Lead identified and onboarded:** There is at least one confirmed Initiative Lead (Ayra member) committed to championing the new Project/Working Group.
* **Initiation Agreement executed:** The Initiative Lead(s) and the Ayra Association have signed the Initiation Agreement, documenting the preliminary scope, success measures, responsibilities, initial funding commitments, and the identification of the initial business case and technical feasibility of the Project/ Working Group.
* **Draft Charter complete:** A draft Charter has been developed, clearly defining the vision, scope, and governance structure of the proposed Project or Working Group. The draft Charter should also outline any planned Working Groups (if proposing a Project), targeted deliverables (e.g., roadmap, conformance documents, governance frameworks, etc.), and the nature of the collaboration (e.g., vendor-neutral industry effort, community-driven initiative, etc.).
* **Pipeline of participants:** A preliminary list of at least a few organizations (or individuals) interested in joining the effort has been gathered. This participant pipeline demonstrates that the Working Group or Project has broader support beyond the Initiative Lead(s). There is no strict minimum number at this stage, but having multiple committed entities is strongly encouraged to show viability.
* **Executive Director approval:** The Ayra Executive Director has reviewed the outcomes of Exploration – including the draft Charter and Initiation Agreement – and approves moving forward. This approval confirms that the concept aligns with Ayra’s mission and that the necessary groundwork (leadership, draft plan, initial funding) is in place to engage the broader community.

Once these criteria are met, the initiative moves into the Proposal Phase.

### Proposal Phase

In the Proposal Phase, the nascent Project or Working Group is made public to the rest of the Ayra community and prospective participants. The goal of this phase is to formally present the draft Charter for review, gather feedback, attract additional participants, and evolve the plan to a finalized state ready for launch.

#### **Activities in Proposal**

Ayra staff will post the draft Charter on an appropriate public forum (such as the Ayra Association website or collaboration portal) for all members to review and comment. An announcement is made to the Ayra membership at large, introducing the proposed Project or Working Group, outlining its purpose and inviting others to join as founding Participants. During this phase, the Initiative Lead(s), Project Manager, and any early Participants will actively recruit additional members to join the initiative. Supporting materials – e.g. recruiting materials – are created and circulated. These materials encapsulate the vision, scope, objectives, and high-level plans, and clearly explain how other members can get involved.

Another focus of the Proposal Phase is to identify and plan for any services or infrastructure the group will need (e.g., collaboration tools, repositories, and communication channels). The Ayra Association will work with the prospective group to determine what support is required to operate and how it can be provided. By the end of this phase, the Charter should be refined based on feedback into a final form, and a core set of initial Participants should be ready to formally commit. The Proposal Phase will last a minimum of [two weeks (14 days)](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] to ensure adequate time for community review and recruitment, though it may be extended as needed to assemble a sufficient coalition.

#### **Exit Criteria**

* **Charter finalized and published:** The initial Charter has been completed, incorporating feedback from the community review, and has been posted publicly in its final form. This Charter includes all required sections (see [here](project-and-working-group-process.md#charter)) and has been approved by the Executive Director as meeting Ayra’s requirements.
* **Recruitment materials and plan in place:** Recruiting materials (e.g., presentation decks, web pages) have been produced, and a recruitment plan has been executed to contact potential participants. This results in broad awareness of the new initiative among relevant stakeholders.
* **Minimum participant commitments:** At least a minimal critical mass of Participants have committed to join, demonstrating multi-party support. As a guideline, at least three (3) distinct members (in addition to the Initiative Lead) have agreed to sign the Participation Agreement and contribute to the effort. The exact number may vary by context, but ideally these founding Participants come from a mix of member classes to ensure diverse representation.
* **Infrastructure needs identified:** Any required infrastructure or services (communication channels, project tools, etc.) for the group’s operation have been identified and planned for. For example, mailing lists or collaboration sites are earmarked, and Ayra staff have a plan to set them up at launch.
* **Executive Director approval:** Subject to all the above and any other feedback, the Executive Director authorizes the formal creation of the Project or Working Group. This is effectively the green light that the group can move ahead into initial operations. If the criteria are not met or significant objections are raised during review, the Executive Director may decide to delay or not approve the launch, in which case further work or changes would be required before proceeding.

Upon satisfying these criteria, the Project or Working Group is formally created by the Ayra Association, and the initiative enters the Development Phase.

### Development Phase

The Development Phase corresponds to the incubation period of the new Project or Working Group. Now formally established, the group begins to operate and implement its programs, while still building up full capacity. This phase is characterized by expanding participation, formalizing the group’s internal organization (committees, roles), and executing initial plans (such as developing deliverables and refining strategies).

#### **Activities in Development**

At this point, Ayra staff will set up the agreed communication infrastructure for the initiative. For example, mailing lists, discussion forums, or other collaboration tools are established so that all Participants can communicate openly. The _Project Management Committee (PMC)_ (or equivalent steering committee) defined in the Charter (see [here](project-and-working-group-process.md#project-management-committee-pmc)) is formally constituted with its initial members (e.g., representatives of the Initiative Lead and other founding Participants). The PMC may hold its first meetings to elect a _Chair_ (if not predefined) and to establish its working rhythms. Any other committees specified in the _Charter_ (e.g., Marketing Committee, Technical Committee) should also be formed at this stage with the appropriate members. If the Charter allows, additional interested Ayra members can continue to join the initiative by signing the Participation Agreement – recruitment is ongoing, and member recruitment remains an active goal and responsibility of the group throughout its lifecycle.

During this phase, the group begins executing on its objectives. A crucial task is for the PMC to create an initial _Program Plan_. The Program Plan is an annual (or multi-year) plan that defines the key strategic goals, initiatives, and timeline for the initiative in pursuit of its vision. It lays out what the group intends to accomplish (e.g., deliverables to produce, events or pilots to run, standards to draft, etc.) and the schedule and milestones for those activities. The Program Plan should be based on input from all Participants and aligned with Ayra’s broader mission; it must be reviewed and approved by the Executive Director. See [here](project-and-working-group-process.md#program-plan) for more information.

Another key aspect of the Development Phase is finalizing the financial and resource model (_Budget_). By this stage, the _Participation Agreements_ should be signed by all initial Participants, obligating them to the Charter and to any participation fees or resource contributions defined for the group. The Ayra Association, in coordination with the PMC, will prepare the first budget for the Project/Working Group. This budget identifies the funding sources (e.g., membership dues, sponsorships, grants) and how those funds will be allocated to support the group’s activities (such as paying for events, tooling, or dedicated staff time). As with all Ayra Project budgets, a Working Group’s budget is subject to approval by the Ayra Board as part of the Association’s overall budget process. The PMC does not bear fiduciary responsibility for managing the money – all funds are held and disbursed by the Ayra Association on behalf of the group – but the PMC is responsible for proposing how the budget should be used to advance the group’s goals. The PMC’s recommendations must align with Ayra’s financial policies, and final spending authority rests with the Ayra Executive Director and Board.

Throughout the Development Phase, the Working Group may continue to recruit new Participants. The focus, however, is on execution - starting to produce the materials and outcomes the group was formed to deliver. _Materials_ include any tangible outputs of the Working Group, such as technology roadmaps, specifications, reference materials, frameworks, documentation, or other assets. All materials developed are expected to be made available under terms consistent with Ayra’s mission (for example, open licenses or public access where appropriate). Unless otherwise agreed with Ayra’s leadership, any names, trademarks, or logos developed for the Project or Working Group are owned by the Ayra Association, ensuring a vendor-neutral identity for the initiative. Specific trademark or intellectual property arrangements can be set in the Charter or agreements, but Ayra’s default is to hold trademarks in trust for the community.

#### **Exit Criteria**

* **Operational infrastructure in place:** The Working Group has established all necessary communications and collaboration channels (e.g., a mailing list, project repositories, website) to conduct its work openly. These are active and accessible to Participants and, for public-facing materials, to the public.
* **Governance bodies functioning:** The Project’s governance structure is fully operational. The Project Management Committee and any other committees (marketing, technical, etc., if applicable) have been formed per the Charter, composed with their members, and are meeting regularly with elected chairs or co-chairs in place. In short, the group’s internal leadership and oversight mechanisms are working.
* **Program Plan and initial deliverables defined:** The PMC has approved an initial Program Plan that lays out the strategic goals and key initiatives for the group. Additionally, the group has defined its first set of deliverables or milestones and begun work toward achieving them. For example, if the goal of a Working Group is to produce a standard or a pilot implementation, it has convened the necessary teams and started the work.
* **Budget approved and funding secured:** A budget for the group’s first cycle (e.g., year) has been drafted in collaboration with Ayra staff, and this budget has received the necessary approval (Executive Director and/or Board approval as required). The funding required to execute the plan – through participant fees, sponsorships, or other sources – has been secured or pledged such that the group is financially ready to operate.
* **Participant base has grown to a sustainable level:** The Working Group has expanded its membership to a sustainable level. As a guideline, at least five (5) Participants are formally committed and active. These participants should ideally reflect a healthy diversity of stakeholders.
* **Executive Director confirmation:** The Ayra Executive Director confirms that the Working Group is ready for long-term operation, having met all the above criteria. At this point, the group is considered fully active and may proceed to ongoing Execution. If any criteria are lacking, the Development Phase may be extended or additional support given to shore up the group’s foundation before proceeding.

When these criteria are fulfilled, the initiative enters the final phase, Execution, where it will carry out its mission on an ongoing basis.

### Execution Phase

The Execution Phase is the steady-state operational phase of a Project or Working Group. In this phase, the group focuses on delivering results and ongoing collaboration according to its charter.&#x20;

#### Activities in Execution

Most of the work (developing materials, running programs, achieving the initiative’s objectives) occurs during Execution. There is no fixed duration for this phase – some initiatives may operate for a defined period to accomplish a specific objective, while others may continue indefinitely as long as they serve a purpose. During Execution, the PMC provides continuous leadership and oversight.&#x20;

The PMC regularly monitors progress against the Program Plan and Charter objectives. It coordinates among Participants to ensure milestones are met and addresses any issues such as scope changes or interdependencies. The PMC is responsible for tracking the group’s activities and ensuring they remain aligned with the approved Charter. It also handles updates to plans and proposes budget adjustments in collaboration with Ayra staff if new needs arise. The Chair of the PMC (or co-chairs) should facilitate regular status meetings and updates. Per Ayra’s transparency principles, the PMC will provide periodic status reports to Ayra leadership and the broader community, detailing key progress, successes, and any challenges. All committees continue to execute their specific mandates during Execution. The group should also maintain open communication with any related external communities or projects.&#x20;

Over time, the Working Group may update its Program Plan to set new goals or adjust to changing circumstances. Any substantive changes to scope or governance would require a Charter amendment, but minor adjustments in focus are expected as part of the normal course of work.

#### **Exit Criteria for Execution (completion or termination)**

Unlike earlier phases, the Execution Phase does not automatically lead to another phase; instead, it continues until the Project or Working Group is either successfully completed or formally terminated. There are two primary scenarios for exiting the Execution Phase:

* **Successful Completion:** The Project or Working Group achieves its objectives or is no longer needed. The Charter’s success criteria or sunset clauses (if any) are met. For example, the Charter may specify that the group will conclude upon delivering a certain deliverable or after a two-year period unless renewed. The PMC may determine that the group’s mission has been fulfilled and recommend closure. In such cases, the PMC should document the outcomes and may hold a final vote to dissolve the group upon completion of its work.
* **Termination Due to Inactivity or Decision:** A Project or Working Group may also be ended if it becomes inactive, fails to meet its objectives, or if participants decide to discontinue it. Termination can be triggered in two ways: (1) a super-majority (two-thirds) vote of the PMC in favor of ending the initiative, requesting the Ayra Executive Director to terminate it; or (2) a determination by the Executive Director that the initiative has become inactive or is not complying with its Charter, at the Executive Director’s sole discretion. In either case, the Executive Director will review the situation and make the final decision on dissolution.

If a Project or Working Group is terminated, the Ayra Association will communicate the closure to the membership and the public. A public notice of termination will be placed on the group’s main communication channel or website, and the group’s status will be updated to “Archived.” All materials produced by the initiative up to that point will be archived by Ayra for posterity and potential future use. Any remaining funds in the group’s budget will be handled in accordance with Ayra’s financial policies (e.g., returned to a general fund or reallocated, as appropriate).

## Governance Structure and Roles

The authority for establishing and managing any project’s budget lies with the Executive Director, and all project budgets roll up into the Association’s overall budget, which is approved annually by the Association’s Board of Directors.

### **Project Management Committee (PMC)**

Each Ayra Project or Working Group is governed by a Project Management Committee (PMC) or equivalent steering committee in the case of a Working Group. The PMC is the primary decision-making and oversight body for the initiative. It provides leadership, approves plans and budgets, and coordinates the Participants’ efforts. It is responsible for steering the group towards its objectives and ensuring compliance with its Charter and Ayra’s policies.&#x20;

#### **Composition**

The composition and formation of the PMC are defined in the Charter. Typically, the PMC comprises representatives of the initiative’s key stakeholders. For instance, the Charter may grant an automatic PMC seat to recognize a major contributing member and include elected or appointed seats for others. The Charter must describe how PMC members are selected and how the PMC is maintained over time (e.g., election procedures, term lengths, addition of new members when new sponsors join). The structure must be objective, fair, and not unduly favour any single member or subset of members.

#### **Chair**

The PMC shall elect a Chair (or co-chairs) from among its members to preside over meetings and serve as the primary liaison for the group. The Chair is responsible for setting meeting agendas, facilitating discussions, and ensuring follow-up on action items. In a Member-led Project, the Chair will typically be a representative of one of the member organizations. In an Ayra-led Project, the Executive Director or a designated Ayra staff member will serve as the PMC Chair to directly lead the initiative on behalf of the Association.

#### **Responsibilities**

The PMC has a broad mandate to manage and guide the Project. Key PMC responsibilities include:

* **Strategic Direction:** Define and adjust (as needed) the strategy to fulfill the Project’s mission, in line with the Charter. The PMC ensures the group remains focused on its agreed scope and goals.
* **Charter Implementation:** Oversee the implementation of the Charter’s provisions, including any programs and the observance of participation guidelines. The PMC interprets the Charter when questions arise and can propose amendments to the Charter if necessary (subject to approval as described above).
* **Work Program Oversight:** Develop and approve the annual Program Plan and any other plans such as for marketing. The PMC monitors the progress of all activities and deliverables, providing direction or making course corrections to keep the project on track.
* **Coordination:** Coordinate among different committees and sub-groups of the Project, ensuring that (for example) marketing efforts align with technical deliverables, and that all parts of the project are moving in harmony.
* **Budget and Resource Allocation:** Propose and review the budget for the Project in collaboration with Ayra management. The PMC helps prioritize how funds should be spent in accordance with the Program Plan (e.g., which key initiatives to fund). While the Ayra Association holds and disburses the funds, the PMC’s recommendations guide those decisions. All budgets must be approved by Ayra’s Executive Director and ultimately by the Board of Directors, as part of Ayra’s standard financial governance. For clarity, PMC members do not carry fiduciary responsibility for the funds – they are advisors on spending, not legal stewards of the money.
* **Membership & Outreach:** Drive the recruitment of new Participants and maintain engagement of existing ones. The PMC may maintain an ongoing list of all Participants and track which organizations are involved. It also plays a role in outward communications – for instance, the PMC (and especially the Chair) may represent the Project in public forums or conferences, promoting its work.
* **Reporting:** Provide regular status reports to the Ayra Association’s leadership (e.g., the Executive Director, the Ayra Board of Directors, Ayra members) about the initiative’s progress, achievements, and challenges to ensure transparency and accountability of the group within the broader Ayra governance structure.
* **Temporary Suspension:** The PMC may vote to temporarily suspend a Project or Working Group’s activities if it determines there are insufficient funds or resources to continue operations effectively. Such a suspension is intended as a pause (not a termination) to allow time for securing additional resources or resolving resource constraints. A decision to suspend should be promptly communicated to the Ayra Executive Director, and the PMC should regularly review the status of the suspension. The project may be resumed when resources are adequate, subject to any conditions set by the PMC in consensus with the Executive Director.

The PMC operates on a consensus-oriented basis where possible, but formal decisions (like approving a plan or budget, or recommending a Charter change) are usually taken by vote. The Charter should specify the voting mechanism (e.g., simple majority, supermajority for certain decisions) and quorum for PMC decisions if it is going to deviate from Ayra norms. All PMC meetings should be conducted under the principles of openness and transparency – with advance notice to members, documented agendas, and minutes published afterward.

### **Additional Committees and Task Forces**

A Project or Working Group may establish additional committees or task forces to focus on specific aspects of its mission, as laid out in its Charter (e.g., a Marketing Committee, Technical Committee, Legal and Intellectual Property Committee etc.)

All committees within a Project or Working Group are expected to collaborate and coordinate with each other as peers, without hierarchy among them. In other words, the PMC (or steering committee) and the different task forces each focus on their respective domains, and one is not subordinate to another by default. This encourages mutual respect and avoids siloed decision-making. Ultimately, the PMC serves as the integrating body to align all committees with the overall vision of the initiative.

Each committee must follow the same openness and antitrust guidelines as the PMC. This includes notifying all eligible members of meetings in advance, keeping meetings open to all members who qualify to attend (per the Charter), and publishing minutes and decisions. All participants must adhere to Ayra’s antitrust policy to ensure discussions stay within appropriate legal bounds.

### **Roles**

The Executive Director will designate an internal _Liaison_ for each Project or Working Group. The Liaison (a member of Ayra’s staff, which can include the Executive Director) ensures that Ayra’s processes are understood and followed by the group and that the group has the support it needs, especially in early phases. They act as the primary liaison between the group and the Ayra Association, facilitating communication and problem-solving.

Additionally, the Executive Director will assign a _Project Manager_ (staff or an external contractor, as resources allow) to assist the group. The Project Manager may be suggested by the Initiative Lead(s). The Project Manager’s duties can include helping to organize meetings, document the group’s plans and progress, evangelize the group’s mission to external stakeholders, and assist with day-to-day execution of the program plan. In some situations, the roles of Liaison and Project Manager might be filled by the same individual. These roles do not supplant the group’s own leadership, but rather provide guidance, administrative support, and a connection to Ayra’s broader resources.

## Documentation and Outputs

Each Project or Working Group will maintain a set of documentation and deliverables throughout its life.

### **Charter**

The foundational document of the Project or Working Group, detailing the vision, scope, governance structure, participation criteria, and other key policies. The Charter must remain accessible to all members. It can be amended only by a supermajority vote of the PMC and Executive Director approval. All Participants are bound by the Charter via the Participation Agreement.

### **Program Plan**

An internal working plan (usually updated yearly) outlining the group’s strategic initiatives, key activities, and timeline. The Program Plan is approved by the PMC and Executive Director and guides the group’s efforts. This plan should be circulated to all Participants and, in the interest of transparency, key elements of it may be shared publicly. The PMC should update the Program Plan regularly and use it to measure progress.

### **Meeting Artifacts**

Agendas and minutes for PMC and committee meetings to ensure transparency in how decisions are made. As a rule, these should be stored in a location accessible to all group Participants, with publicly accessible archives for at least the PMC’s main communications. This might be an Ayra-provided mailing list archive or a section of the Ayra website/wiki.

### **Deliverables**

All outputs of the Project or Working Group (reports, specifications, code, frameworks, event recordings, etc.) should be documented and published through appropriate channels. The Charter will typically specify how and where deliverables are published (_e.g._, in an Ayra repository or on a dedicated website). Unless a different intellectual property arrangement is approved by Ayra, any original content produced by the group is made available under open terms consistent with Ayra’s principles, and any third-party content incorporated is done so under proper licenses or contribution agreements. The Ayra Association may require contributors to sign or click-accept certain terms of use or contributor agreements to ensure everything is properly licensed and can be shared.

### **Participation Records**

The PMC (with help from the Project Manager) should keep an up-to-date list of current Participants and their roles. This is important for knowing who is eligible to vote on matters, who to invite to meetings, and for assessing whether the group maintains the diversity and quorum it needs. Changes in membership, such as new Participants joining or existing ones withdrawing, should be recorded and, when significant, noted in meeting minutes or reported to Ayra staff.

### **Approval of Deliverables**

The Executive Director may review and approve completed Project or Working Group outputs, designating them as formally endorsed deliverables of the Ayra Association. If the Executive Director approves an output in this manner, it becomes an official Ayra Association deliverable. If the Executive Director declines to approve a particular deliverable as official, that decision may be appealed to the Ayra Board of Directors.

In addition to the above, the Ayra Association may provide an Operations Guide or similar reference materials to help groups with best practices on running effective meetings, using collaboration tools, community building, etc., in line with Ayra’s overall methodology.

## Agreements

Collaborative work in Ayra Projects and Working Groups is underpinned by formal agreements to ensure clarity of responsibilities and commitments. Participants in any Project or Working Group are also subject to the overarching policies of the Ayra Association. For example, the Ayra Intellectual Property Policy and the Ayra Antitrust Policy will apply to all group activities and deliverables. The Charter and its agreements will reference these where relevant. All policies and operations must maintain a vendor-neutral, antitrust-compliant stance. Ayra retains ownership of communal assets like names and trademarks to ensure neutrality (unless otherwise specified by explicit agreement). Ayra may combine the Initiation and Participation Agreement into a single integrated contract for simplicity.&#x20;

### **Initiation Agreement**

An Initiation Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Ayra Association and the Initiative Lead(s) launching a Project or Working Group. It details the initial goals, scope, success metrics, and the roles of each party in getting the initiative off the ground. Critically, it enumerates any startup funding or resources the Initiative Lead will provide, as since the Initiative Lead(s) is expected to fund required startup work until broader funding via participation fees is in place. It may also cover branding considerations (_e.g._, trademark usage for a Project’s name), website domain setup, and other preliminary logistics.

### **Participation Agreement**

Each organization or individual that wishes to join as a Participant must execute a Participation Agreement with Ayra. This agreement commits the Participant to the terms of the Charter and to any financial contributions or fees required by that Charter. By signing, the Participant agrees to abide by the Ayra and Charter’s principles and policies (e.g., antitrust, confidentiality if applicable, code of conduct) and to pay the specified participation fee for the project. The Participation Agreement typically clarifies that the Participant has no ownership of any collective work product and that they will adhere to any intellectual property contribution rules in line with Ayra's policies. In essence, the Participation Agreement grants the member formal status in the initiative and binds them to follow the rules the group has set.
