# Transparency Statement

## Transparency and Open Operations

Ayra is committed to operating in a transparent, open, and accountable manner, consistent with best practices used by open standards bodies and nonprofit foundations.

Our work is conducted primarily through publicly accessible documentation, discussions, and records, so that members, stakeholders, and the broader public can understand how decisions are made and how the organization operates.

## Public-by-Default Documentation

Unless there is a clear and documented reason otherwise, the following materials are made publicly available:

- Governance charters and policies  
- Working group charters and scopes  
- Meeting agendas and meeting notes  
- Decisions, resolutions, and outcomes  
- Proposals and discussion records  

These materials are maintained in public repositories and are accessible without requiring membership or login.

## Member Participation and Editing Rights

Ayra encourages broad participation and engagement from the community. To ensure accountability and document integrity:

- Editing rights for official documents are limited to members or authorized contributors  
- Changes to official records follow documented review and approval processes  
- All substantive changes are traceable through version history  

This approach balances openness with responsible stewardship of official records.

## Decision-Making Transparency

Decisions are made in accordance with the processes defined in Ayra’s governance charter and applicable working group charters.

When decisions are taken:

- The context and rationale are documented  
- Decisions are recorded and timestamped  
- References to supporting discussions or meetings are provided where applicable  

This ensures decisions can be understood, reviewed, and audited over time.

## Use of Collaboration Platforms

Ayra uses multiple platforms to support its work:

- **Public repositories** serve as the system of record for governance, working group outputs, meeting notes, and decisions  
- **Member collaboration platforms** are used for coordination, discussion, and announcements  

When discussions occur in member-only spaces, outcomes and decisions are summarized and recorded publicly wherever possible.

## Exceptions to Transparency

In limited circumstances, certain information may not be made public. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Personal or sensitive personal information  
- Confidential legal, contractual, or security-related matters  
- Information subject to privacy, regulatory, or ethical constraints  

Any exceptions to transparency are applied narrowly and only when necessary.

---

## Ongoing Commitment

Transparency is an ongoing commitment. Ayra periodically reviews its practices to ensure they remain effective, proportionate, and aligned with its mission and community expectations.

Questions or concerns regarding transparency may be raised through the appropriate governance channels.
