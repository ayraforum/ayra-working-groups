## **1\. Motivation and Background**

The Ayra Card Working Group (ACWG) is being established to formalize the Ayra Card protocol. The general idea of using the Ayra Card protocol is gaining steam at Ayra, and the need to formalize the required artifacts has become urgent. 

The ACWG aims to meet the needs of all three pillars of the Ayra community:

* **Business:** establishing the artifacts that the business community needs (e.g. business use cases, integration playbooks, trustmark) to use the Ayra Card protocol in their efforts.
* **Governance:** establishing governance frameworks, trust frameworks, and policy structures that enable organizations to confidently adopt and implement the Ayra Card protocol to support the establishment of a global trust layer.
* **Technology:** developing technical specifications, schemas, reference implementations, and conformance test suites that ensure interoperability and consistent implementation of the Ayra Card protocol across different platforms and vendors.

This working group is being initiated to address the need for a standardized, interoperable approach to digital credential exchange in the identity ecosystem. The Ayra Card protocol has emerged as a promising solution for enabling verifiable credential presentation across diverse use cases, from day-to-day personal interations, employee badges use, through to supply chain transparency. However, without formal specifications, governance frameworks, and conformance criteria, implementations risk fragmentation and incompatibility.

The working group brings together business stakeholders, governance experts, implementers, and developers, who recognize that successful adoption requires more than just technical specifications. Organizations need clear business cases, integration guidance, trustmarks for vendor selection, consistent rituals, and governance frameworks that address privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. The ACWG will create these essential artifacts while maintaining the agility to iterate rapidly through proof-of-concept implementations that validate real-world utility.

## **2\. Scope**

The Ayra Card Working Group is responsible for establishing the business, governance, and technical artifacts required for the Ayra Card Protocol. [note: the term "protocol" is being used as a business and marketing term here.]

The following will constitute the activities and interest areas of this working group:

- Governing the **Ayra Card Proof of Concept** process, which is an ongoing set of short (60-90 day) iterations that aim to demonstrate business utility.
- Establishment of conformance criteria that will be used in the [Ayra Conformance Test Suite (CTS)](https://github.com/ayraforum/conformance-test-suite). 
- Governing the Ayra Card aspects of the Ayra Conformance Test Suite.
- Establishment of schema, context documents, presentation request, and other artifacts required for full system conformance.
- Creation of business material to bolster the case for the Ayra Card protocol.
- Establishment and guidance of the Ayra Card Governance Framework. 


### **2.1 Out of Scope**

The following will *not* be addressed by this working group:

* Revisions to underlying specifications (e.g. DIDComm, Aries RFCs, OID4VP). While the WG may gather inputs to provide to the SDOs that maintain the specifications, the revisions will not be conducted at Ayra.
* Wallet implementation or certification beyond conformance to Ayra Card presentation protocols.
* Credential issuance standards or processes (except where directly related to Ayra Card presentation requirements).
* Blockchain or distributed ledger technology selection or implementation.
* General identity management or authentication mechanisms not specific to Ayra Card protocol.

## Working Group Meetings

**Schedule:** Meeting schedule to be determined by the Working Group Chair(s) and participants based on availability and time zone distribution. The Working Group will hold regular meetings (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly as determined by the group). If needed, meetings may be held in multiple editions to accommodate global time zones.

**Responsibilities:** Chairs, designated Participants or designated Ayra staff will share the invitation, meeting link, and other needed logistics, as well as producing one consolidated set of meeting minutes combining both editions. 

**Observers:**  Non-Ayra members may attend meetings as Observers only. If you or your employer is not a member of Ayra, you may not participate in meetings by verbal contribution or otherwise take any action beyond watching the meeting.
