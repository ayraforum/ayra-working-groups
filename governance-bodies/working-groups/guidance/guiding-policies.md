## Communication Policies

If changes to this boilerplate are made, the Board may ask for an explanation before the ratification vote. 

**Working in Public:** Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in public. The meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review and technical discussions. Issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. 

**Meeting Minutes:** Chairs or another Participant will produce one consolidated set of meeting minutes for each meeting set (e.g. Americas/EU/Africa and APAC meetings) combining both editions. (Where it is helpful, the minutes will indicate which notes were taken in which meeting.) Minutes will be posted on the group’s GitHub repo (add link or alternative site URL). Minutes will be published publicly within 1 week of the close of the second meeting. 

**Draft Specifications:** Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of artifacts will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

**Group Information:** Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available at (group GitHub repo or other public URL). 

**Mailing List:** This group primarily conducts its work (pick one, or both, as appropriate): 
- on the public mailing list and via GitHub Issues public-\[working group name\]@ayra.forum 
- or on [GitHub issues](%20https://github.com/orgs/ayraforum/repositories). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.

**Confidential  Communication:** The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

## Decision Policies

If a Working Group or Task Force diverges from the decision policies here, the Board may ask for explanation before the ratification vote. 

**Working by Consensus**: Working Groups and Tasks Forces will seek to make decisions through consensus. Typically, an Editor or other Participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with the group's Participants, and consensus emerges with little formal voting required.

**Voting**: However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chair(s) may call for a group vote. The decision, along with any objections, will be recorded in the public minutes of the meeting. 

**Calls for Consensus**: To support asynchronous decision-making and deliberation, any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or a teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from (pick a duration within: one week to 10 working days), depending on the Chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have achieved consensus as a Working Group resolution. 

**Resolved Decisions**: All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless new information becomes available or reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.



## Participation Policies

If changes to this boilerplate are made, the Board may ask for explanation before the ratification vote. Text is drawn from the W3C charter template[\*](#w3c-working-group-charter-template). 

**Member Participants**: To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementers, such as Active Editors and Test Leads. 

**Member Time Commitment**: The Chairs and other key implementers are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards this Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.

**Public Participants**: The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing list and document repositories, as described in [Communication](#4.2-communication). Members of the public (i.e. not members of Ayra) may attend meetings as Observers only. If you or your employer is not a member of Ayra, you may not participate in meetings by verbal contribution or otherwise take any action beyond watching the meeting and reading materials created by the Working Group.  

**Invited Experts**: The Chairs should periodically review the non-Members who have contributed to the Working Group and consider whether each should be invited to participate as an Invited Expert. If a non-Member contributor would like to participate in meetings, they are encouraged to apply to be an Invited Expert.

**To Join**: Any Ayra member may become a Participant by contacting one of the Chairs listed at the beginning of this charter and following their internal membership process, providing they meet the Working Group Eligibility Criteria. Ayra staff can provide contact information. Non-Ayra members may attend meetings as Observers (see above), but must become members of Ayra Association before being able to join the Working Group as Member Participants.
